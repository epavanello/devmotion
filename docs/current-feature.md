Handle this need, handle/support file upload properly for images and videos, actually image accept only src, should accept also a file. Then allow that the project store securely files on s3 like configurable storage provider. And support the preview. The video layer should define the seconds from start and and, need to be rendered in a proper way in the timeline, and let users to cut/split/resize it. Be sure that server side rendering will show the proper frames in the capture, and merge the audio tracks properly. Also allow to upload/record audios, and manage properly via vercel ai and openrouterr providers the caption generator and preview (this probably should be an audio layer with captions style to be shown ) also for audio handle properly the timeline, split, crop, move. Apply the same concept of enter/exit time for other layers, so we can handle more layers together and visually. Don’t struggle to fix errors, the environment can’t be tested or checked completely, so implement it and I’ll test and tune it.
